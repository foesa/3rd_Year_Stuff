# Definition
> A tentative evaluation or rough calculation

> A preliminary calculation of the cost of a project

> A judgement bases on one's impresions; opinions

## Difference from Targets and Commitments
- Target: Description of a desirable business objective
- Commitment: A promise to deliver defined functionality at a specific level of quality, by a certain date
- Which is more amibitious?
    - Commitment

## How is it Different from a Plan?
- A plan is biased
    - Goal seeking process
- A plan usually has a target
- An estimate should be *un-biased*

## Typical Estimate
- Simplistic single-point estimates assume that nothing will go wrong
    - Unrealistic
- Better to show a range of duration

|Probability of Success|Estimated Completion Time|
|-|-|
|90%|24 Weeks|
|75%|22 Weeks|
|50%|20 Weeks|
|25%|18 Weeks|
|0% |16 Weeks|

> A good estimation approach should provide estimaes that are within 25% of actual results, 75% of the time

### Why does this not Happen?
- Staff not ready when planned
- Requirements moved
- Staff diverting to support trade show
- Unstable functionality removed
- Requirements added
- Less experienced staff than expected
- Staff diverted to support old project
- More requirements added

# A Good Estimate
> A good estimate  is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project reality to allow the project leadership to make good decisions about how to control the project and hit its targets

## How do you Produce a Good Estimate?
- Count
    - Things that are highly correlated with size of softtware being estimated
        - Use Cases
        - Number of UIs, Data Tables, Web Pages, ...
    - Things are available as early as possible
        - High level use cases
            - Refine as soon as you get low level use cases
    - Things you have counted before
        - So you have meaningful statistics
- Compute
    - Use historical data to convert count into estimate
- Judge
    - Only as a last result
    - Last accurate mechanism
    - Most subjectivity and bias

## Judgement Techniques
- Decomposition and Recomposition
    - Divide project into smaller parts
        - Choose form of decomposition
    - Estimate each small part
        - Use multiple techniques to arrive at estimates
    - Recompose
        - Sum up/Multiply

# Techniques
- Select similar projects
- Combine with decomposition and recomposition

## Recommended Estimation Process
- Use multiple types of estimation approaches
- Use experts to converge on a range with probability distribution
- Revise at least twice, as more detail is available

## Other Estimation Procedures
- COCOMO
    - Based on lots of historical data
    - Based on lots of experts
    - Well-known
- Function Points
    - Counting 'functions' in a software
    - Different types of 'functions'
        - UI
        - Computation
        - Transaction
        - ...
    - Not well known
- Wideband Delphi
