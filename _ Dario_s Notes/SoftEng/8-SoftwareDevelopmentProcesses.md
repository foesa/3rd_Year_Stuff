# Phases on an Extreme Programming Project
- Planning
- Design
- Coding
- Testing

|Good Practice|Pushed to the Extreme|
|-|-|
|Code Reviews|Pair Programming|
|Testing|TDD and constant regression|
|Software Design|Relentless Refactoring|
|Simplicity|The simplest thing that could possibly work|
|Integrated Testing|Continuous Integration|
|Soft Iterations|The Planning Game|

## Release Planning
- A project can be quantified by four variables:
    - Scope: How much is to be done?
	- Resources: How many people are available?
	- Time: When will the release happen?
	- Quality: How well-tested is the release?
- Choose any 3
- Management chooses 2
- Dev team chooses 1
- Create user stories
- Estimate ideal programming weeks for each story
    - No dependencies
	- No extra work
	- Include tests
- Customer decides which story has highest priority
- Project velocity is used to calculate number of iterations left

# Scrum
- Tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball ack and forth

## Sprint Backlog
- A sprint is the basic unit for development. Time boxed in advanced
- A sprint is planning meeting creates the sprint backlog and definition of done
- A sprint review meeting updates the sprint backlog
