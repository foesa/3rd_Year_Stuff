# Design Patterns
## How to create pleasing structure?
- Identify a few simple patterns
- Ensure all forces are balanced
- Rinse, repeat

## Building Software
- Is quite a bit like creating a building
- Many forces to take into account
- Many variables that change over time

## Notion of Design Patterns
- Evolved from 'real building terminology'
- Allows certain elegant solutions in the presence of:
    - Common problems
	- Common tools
	- Common forces of change

## Design Principles
- Identify aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
- Favor *composition* over *inheritance*

# Strategy Pattern
## Pattern 1
- Defines a family of algorithms/behaviour, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable
- Strategy lets algorithm vary independently from the client that uses it

# Observer Pattern
- Defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified automatically
