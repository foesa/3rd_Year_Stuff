# Introduction to UML
## Object Orientated Design
- Criteria to be an object
    - Has Attributes
	- Has Behaviours
	- Can have an identity

### Design
- Object-orientated programs work by making objects calloborate with each other, manipulating state and behaviour, in some particular order

> How do you express this and abstract your program to explain to someone who doesn't code

## Communicating Design
- Design on a whiteboard mostly ends up as a set of cirles, boxes and lines
- We need a common language to communicate so every object can *do* the right thing at the right *time*

## UML
- A common (mostly diagrammatic) language to describe a system
    - Structure
	- Behaviour

## Tyoes
- Structural view
    - Class diagram
    - Package diagram
    - Component diagram
- Behavioural view
    - Activity diagram
    - Sequence diagram
    - Use Case diagram
	
### Structural view
- Depicts at various leels of abstraction, the way code is arranged in a system

### Types of UML Diagrams
