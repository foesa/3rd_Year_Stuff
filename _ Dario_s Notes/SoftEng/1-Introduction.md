## What is software engineering?
Engineering principles and practice that convert the art of programming into reliable software product/projects.

### The 'Art' or Programming
Virtues of a good programmer (according to Larry Wall)

- Laziness
- Impatience
- Hubris

### What's wrong with the 'art'?
- I'll design it as I go along
- I don't need to write down my ideas
- It'll be done when I'm done

### If you're engineering it
- You need to know *what* to build
- You need to know *how* to build it
- You need to build it
- You need to *document* what you're doing
- You need to do it on time

## Topics Covered in this Module
- Requirements
    - Eliciation, specification, validation
- Design
    - General concepts, key issues
- Architecture
    - Structures, styles, patterns
- Testing
    - Techniques, processes
- Software Engineering Processes

### Activities Expected from You
- Listen in class (your exam will be directly based on discussion in class)
- Complete your assignments (every week)
- Reflect on your assignment feedback
- Reading list (Read these *before* you come to class)

### Assignments - Details
- Account for 70% of your final grade
- Programming assignments
    - Well-defined input/output
    - Submission via source-control
- Your code will be tested against test inputs


## Personal Software Process
- Invented by Watts Humphrey at Software Engineering Institute
- Structured programming process intended to allow programmers to better understand and improve themselves
- Main components
    - Scripts
    - Tracking
    - Postmortem

### Evidence Based Software Development
- PSP got one thing right: no evidence, no improvement
- So, for every phrase of the assignment, record *estimated* and *actual* time
- Calculate *velocity* of your own process
- So, you get a personalised how of how you code

### Your Process
- Planning
- Designing
- Coding
- Testing

*Planning is **not** optional*

- Keep an Engineer's Log throughout your coding process
