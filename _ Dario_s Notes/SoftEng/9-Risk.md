# Classification
|Knowledge Availablity|Example|
|-|-|
|Known knowns|Too many features, too little time, too few resources...|
|Unknown unkowns|Have we captured all the requirements?|
|Unknown unknowns|Technologyical, environmental, political|

# Management
|Processes Involved|What it does|
|-|-|
|Risk identification|List precisely all the risk events possible in a project|
|Risk analysis|Define probablity of occurence, potential for loss|
|Risk planning|Preventive measures to reduce likelihood or impact of risk event|
|Risk monitoring|Match measures to re-calculated probabilities|

# Identification
Spontaneous and sporadic risk identification is usually not enough. Some techniques to systematically elicit risks:

- Team meeting
- Comparison with past projects
- Decomposition
- Checklist/taxonomies

Try and list risks using the condition-transition-consequence forat

> Given hat `<condition>` then there is a concern that 9possibly0 `<transition>` could `<consequence>`

# Anaylisis
Transform the identifies risks into decision-making format

How to decide what to ignore?

## Risk Exposure
- Calculate the Risk-Exposure by multiplying the probability and imact
- `Exposure = Probability * Impact`

# Priotise
- All risks are not created equal
    - Sort by exposure
- Define a cut-off line
    - Only risks above the line are attended to
	- The rest 8stay in the table8 and are monitored
	
# Planning
- *Information Buying*: Throw array prototype to check out new technology
- *Contigency Plan*: Agree on action to take, is certain event happens
- *Risk Reduction*: Change budget/resource/feature to reduce risk
- *Risk Acceptance*: Consciously choose to live with consequences of risk

Mitigation activities to eliinate or resolve risk events:

- *Risk avoidance*: Given a choice between two alternatives, choose the less risky one
- *Risk protection*: Protect against data loss through redundancy checksumming

# Leverage
`Risk Leverage = (exposure before mitigation - exposure after mitigation) / cost of mitigation

# Magae your risk
- Continually review requirements against what you're doing
- Prioritise risk avoidance/amelioration in your task-list
- Be willing to modify your project plan
