# Databse Design
- Need of a formal method for analysing how the relations and attributes are grouped
- A measure of appropriateness or foodness other than the intuition of the design
    - To asses the quality of the design
- Measures
    - Design guidelines
	- Functional Dependencies
	- Normalisation

# Design Guidelines
- A set of informal guidelines
    - Can be used as measures to determine the quality of a relation schema design
    	- Attribute Semantics
		- Reduction of Redundancy
		- Reduction of NULLs
		- Generation of Spurious Tuples
- These measures are not always independent of one another

# Attributes Semantics
- Attributes belonging to a relation have certain real-world meaning
- Semantics of a relation
    - Refers to its meaning resulting from the interpretation of attribute values in a tuple
- Careful entity relationship modeling and accurate mapping to logical dsign help to ensure that a relational schema design has clear meaning

# Guideline 1
- Design a relation schema so that is it easy to explain its meaning
- Give relations and attributes meaningful names
- Do not combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationship types into a single relation
    - Straightforward to interpret
	- Easy to explain its meaning

## Reduction of Redundancy
- One goal of database schema design is to minimise the storage space used
- Grouping attributes into relation schemas has a significant effect on storage space
- Storing merged entities in singple relations leads to another problem, *update anomalies*
- Update anomalies can be classified into
    - Insertion anomalies
	- Deletion anomalies
	- Modification anomalies

### Insertion Anomalies
- To insert a new employee into EMP_DEPT, it is necessary to include either
    - All attributes values for the department that the employee works for
	- NULLs, if the employee is not yet assigned
- Consistency becomes an issue
- Inserting a new department is difficult

### Deletion Anomalies
- Deletion of Employees and Departments inextricably linked
    - If we delete the last employee currently assigned to a particular department, the information related to department is lost from the database
- This problem does not occur is using separate relations

### Modification Anomalies
- Modification akes consistency an issue
- If the manager of a department is changed
    - It is necessary to update the typles of every employee who works for that department
	- Records can easly get out of sync
- This problem does not occur is using separate relations

# Guideline 2
- Design the relation schemas so that no insertion, deletion of modification anomalies are present
    - If anomalies are present, note them clearly and ensure all application programs operate correctly
- This second guideline is consistent with guideline 1

## Reduction of NULLs
- If many attributes do not apply to all the typles of a relation, you end up with many NULL values in those tuples
    - Waste storage space
	- Can make understanding attribute meanings more difficult
	- Leads to difficultly with joins
	- Difficulty with aggregate functions
    	- COUNT and SUM
- A NULL value may typically have two interpretations
    - Missing but inapplicable
    	- Post Code for Irish Addresses (outside of Dublin)
	- Missing by applicable
    	- An employees date of birth is empty
    		- Uknown
			- Known but absent

# Guideline 3
- Avoiding placing attributes in a relation schema whose values may frequencly be NULL
    - If NULLs are unavoidable, ensure they apply in exceptional cases and not the majority of typles
- Using space efficiently and avoiding joins on NULL values are the main criteria for deciding upon attribute inclusion or exclusion
    - If excluded, create a separate relation for that attribute

## Violating
- If only 15% of employees have an office, the including an Office Number attribute in the EMPLOYEE relation would violate guideline 3
    - Instead, create an EMPLOYEE_OFFICE relation
	- This could contain the attributes
    	- Ssn, Office Number
	- A typle is entered in the relation for all employees with an office

## Generation of Spurious Tuples
- Joins across relations should only be performed on *Primary Key - Foreign Key* pairs of attributes
- If joins are performed on attributes which are not a Primary Key - Foreign Key pairing, spurious tuples are generated as a result
    - These tuples represent information which is not valid

# Guideline 4
- Design relation schemas so that they can be joined using equality conditions on primary key, foreign key pairs
    - This guarantees that no spurious tuples are generated by the join
- Avoid relations that contain matching attributes that are not foreign key, primary key combination

# Design Guidelines
- Informal measures used to determine the quality of a relational schema design
    - Ensure that attribute semantics are easily understood
	- Reduce the redundant information in tuples
	- Reduce the number of NULL values in tuples
	- Ensure that spurious typles are not generated by enforcing primary key, foreign key matching

# Database Optimisation
- Need of a formal method for analysing how the relations and attributes are grouped
- A measure of appropriateness or goodness other than the intuition of the designer
    - To access the quality of the design
- Measures
    - Design guidelines
	- Functional dependencies
	- Normalisation

## Functional Dependencies
- Formal tool for analysis of relational schemas
    - Enables the designer to detect and describe design problems in more precise terms
- One of the most important concepts in relational schema design theory
- Main tool for measuring the appropriateness of grouping of attributes into relations

### Definition
- A *functional dependency* is a constraint between two sets of attributes
- Suppose our relational database schema has n attributes
    - A~1~, A~2~, ..., A~n~
- Think of the whole database as being described by a single universal relation
    - R = {A~1~, A~2~, ..., A~n~}
- A functional dependency denoted by X $\rightarrow$ Y, specifies a constraint on the possible tuples that can form a relation state r of R
    - Between two sets of attributes X and Y
	- X and Y are subsets of the relation R
- The constraint is
    - For any two tuples t~1~ and t~2~ in r(R) that have t~1~[X] = t~2~[X]
- The values of the attributes set X from a tuple in r, uniquely (of *functionally*) determine the values of the attribute set Y
    - We can say that:
    	- There is a *function dependency* from X to Y
	- or
    	- Y is *functionally dependent* on X
- The abbreviation for functional dependency if FD
    - The set of attributes X is called the left-hand side of the FD, Y is called the right-hand side
- Thus
    - X functionally determines Y in a relation schema R if, and only if, whenever two tuples agree on their X values, they must necessarily agree on their Y values

### Things to Note
- If X is a candidate key of R, then
    - X $\rightarrow$ Y for any subset of attributes Y or F
	- This, X $\rightarrow$ R
	- In other words, if X has to be unique for every instance of R, then X uniquely determines all the other attribute values of R
- If X $\rightarrow$ Y in R, this does not necessarily imply that Y $\rightarrow$ X in R
    - Not commutative

### Identification of FDs
- A *functional dependency* is a property of the semantics or meaning of the attributes
    - A database designer will use their understanding of the semantics of the attributes of R to specify the functional dependencies that must hold on all instances of R
    	- Entity relationship modelling supports the development of this understanding

### Example
- Consider

**EMP_PROJ**

|   |       |     |     |     |         |
|---|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
|Ssn|Pnumber|Hours|Ename|Pname|Plocation|

- Using the semantics of the attributes and relation, the following FDs should hold:
    - Ssn $\rightarrow$ Ename
	- Pnumber $\rightarrow$ {Pname, Plocation}
	- {Ssn, Pnumber} $\rightarrow$ Hours

### Disproving a FD
- You cannot use a single set of data - r(R) - to prove a FD, but you can use it to disprove a FB

|Smith  |Data Management|Martin	|
|Hall   |Compilers		|Moffman|
|Brown  |Data Structures|Martram|

- Canot prove Text $\rightarrow$ Course
- Can disprove Teacher $\rightarrow$ Course

### Constraints
- Whenever the semantics of two sets of attributes of R indicate that a FD should hold, the dependency is specified as a *constraint*
- Hence, FDs are used to further enhance a relation schema R, by specifying constraints that must hold *at all times*

## Normalisation
- The normalisation process takes a relation schema through a series of tests to certify whether is satisfies a certain *normal form*
- There are a number of normal forms:
    - First Normal Form
	- Second Normal Form
	- Third Normal Form
	- Boyce-Codd Normal Form
- Evaluates each relation against the criteria for normal forms
    - Decompose relations where necessary
- Can be considered *relational design by analysis*
    - ER Modelling
	- Mapping to Relational Schema
	- Functional Dependencies
	- Normalisation
- The process of analysing relation schemas based upon their primary keys and functional dependencies in order to:
    - Minimise redundancy
	- Minimise insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies
- Relations which do not pass the normal form tests are decomposed into smaller relation schemas
- Normalisation through decomposition must confirm two properties in the resulting database design
    - Non-Additive or Lossless Join Property
    	- This guarantees that spurious tuple generation does not occur
	- Dependency Preservation Property
    	- This ensures that each functional dependency is represented in an individual relation
- Provides database designers with:
    - A formal framework for analysing relations based upon their primary keys and functional dependencies
	- A set of normal form tests that can be carried out on individual relation schemas so that the relational database can be normalised to the desired degree

### First Normal Form
- In 1NF all attribute values must be atomic
    - The word atom comes from the Latin atomis, meaning indivisible (or literally, "not to cut")
- 1NF dictates that at every row-column intersection, there exists only one value, not a list of values
- The benefits from this rule should be fairly obvious
    - If lists of values are stored in a single column, there is no simple way to manipulate those values

- 1NF also disallows multi-valued attributes that are themselves composite
- Remove the attributes that violates 1NF and put it into a separate, new relation
- Add the primary key of the original relation to the new relation
    - This will serve as a foreign key
- The primary key of the new relation is a composite primary key
- This *decomposes* a non-1NF relation into two 1NF relations

### Second Normal Form
- A table is said to be in Second Normal Form if:
    - It is 1NF compliant
	- Every non-key column if *fully functionally dependent* ont he entire primary key
- In other works
    - Tables should only store data relating to one "thing" (or entity)
	- That entity should eb described by its primary key

#### Full Functional Dependency
- A FD X $\rightarrow$ Y is said to be a *full functional dependency* if the removal of any single attribute from the set of attributes X means that the dependency no longer holds
    - Think of X as a composite primary key
	- All the other attributes must be dependent upon the full key, not just part of it
- For an attribute A $\varepsilon$ X
    - (X - {A}) does not functionally determine Y

#### Partial Functional Dependency
- A FD X $\rightarrow$ Y is said to be a *partial functional dependency* is a single attribute can be removed from the set of attributes X yet the dependency still holds
- For any attribute A $\varepsilon$ X
    - (X - {A}) $\rightarrow$ Y

#### Achieving 2NF
- Limit the FDs to only the parts of the key that they are dependent upon
- Decompose the relation into separate relations using these FDs
- The primary key of the new relations is the left-hand side of the FD
- This *decomposes* a non-2NF relation into a set of new 2NF relations

### Third Normal Form
- A table is said to be in Third Normal Form if:
    - It is 2NF compliant
	- No non-key attributes are *transitively dependent* upon the primary key
- A function dependency X $\rightarrow$ Y in the relation R, is said to be a *transitive dependency* if:
    - There exists a set of attributes Z in R which is neither a candidate key or a subset of any key of R
	- And both X $\rightarrow$ Z and Z $\rightarrow$ Y hold true

#### Transitive Dependency
- Ssn $\rightarrow$ Dmgr_ssn is a transitive dependency through Dnumber
    - Ssn $\rightarrow$ Dnumber and Dnumber $\rightarrow$ Dmgr_ssn hold
	- Dnumber is not a key itself or a subset of any key of EMP_DEPT

#### Achieving 3NF
- Identify any transitive dependencies in the relation
- Decompose the relation into two separate relations using these transitive dependencies
- The primary key of the new relation is the middle attribute of the transitive dependency
- This *decomposes* a non-3NF relation into two new 3NF relations

### 2NF and 3NF
- Any functional dependency in which the left hand side is...
    - a non-key attribute or
	- a component attribute of a coposite primary key

...is a problematic FD

- 2NF and 3NF remove these problem FDs by decomposing them into new relations

### Superkey
- A *superkey* SK is any set of attributes in the relation R, whose combined values will be unique for every tuple
    - t~1~[SK] $\neq$ t~2~[SK]
- Every relation has one default superkey - the key of all its attributes
    - As, by definition, every instance of a relation must be unique

### Boyne-Codd Normal Form
- BCNF was created to be a simpler form of 3NF
    - Sometimes called 3.5NF
- However, it was found to be stricter than 3NF
    - Every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF
	- Every relation in 3NF is not necessarily in BCNF
- A table is said to be in Boyce-Codd Normal Form if:
    - Whenevr a functional dependency X $\rightarrow$ Y holds in the relation R, X is a superkey of R

#### Achieving BCNF
- Identify all functional dependencies in the relations
    - Identify any FDs where the left-hand side is not a superkey
- Decompose the relation into separate relations, creating a new relation for the offending FD
- The primary key of the new relation is the left hand attribute of the offending functional dependency
- This *decomposes* a non-BCNF relation into two new BCNF relations

## Normalisation
- Normalisation tests a relation schema to certify whether it satisfies a *normal form*
    - 1NF
	- 2NF
	- 3NF
	- BCNF
- Evaluate each relation against the criteria for each normal form in turn
    - Decompose relations where necessary

# Modelling a Database
- Identify and model
    - The required entities and attributes
	- The relationships between those entities
- Map from the conceptual model to a relational schema
- Identify the functional dependencies in the relation schemas
- Normaise the relation schemas
